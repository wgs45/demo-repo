# 🧠🌈 **Proof Skills: Rules of Inference**

_(A beautifully logical adventure through reasoning, deduction, and truth~)_

---

## 🌟 **0. Course Objectives — The Magic You’ll Master (3 mins)**

By the end of this lesson, you’ll:
🪶 Understand **what Rules of Inference** are and why they matter in mathematical proofs.
⚙️ Recognize the **most common inference rules** — Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, and more.
✨ Learn how to **apply these rules** to form logically correct conclusions and avoid fallacies.

🎯 _Goal:_ To think like a mathematician… or a calm, clever wizard of truth~ 💫

## 🌧️ **1. Why Do We Need Rules of Inference? (7 mins)**

💬 **Situation:**

> If it rains, then I will bring an umbrella.
> It’s raining now → Therefore, I bring an umbrella.

✔️ _Correct inference!_ (This is **Modus Ponens** 🪄)

But—beware of logical traps!

> If it rains, then I will bring an umbrella.
> I don’t have an umbrella → Therefore, it’s not raining.

❌ _Wrong!_ (You might’ve simply forgotten it ☂️)

✨ _Moral of the story:_
Rules of inference keep our reasoning **valid** and **fallacy-free**, ensuring mathematical proofs don’t crumble like cookies 🍪.

## 📘 **2. The Core Inference Rules (20 mins)**

### 💠 (a) **Primary Rules — The Foundations of Logic**

---

### 1️⃣ **Modus Ponens (Affirming the Antecedent)**

🧩 Rule: _If p → q, and p is true, then q is true._
🌧️ Example:
If it rains (p), then I’ll bring an umbrella (q).
It rains today (p).
→ Therefore, I’ll bring an umbrella (q). ☂️✔️

---

### 2️⃣ **Modus Tollens (Denying the Consequent)**

🧩 Rule: _If p → q, and q is false, then p is false._
🍦 Example:
If I eat ice cream (p), I’ll feel cool (q).
I don’t feel cool (¬q).
→ Therefore, I didn’t eat ice cream (¬p).

---

### 3️⃣ **Hypothetical Syllogism**

🧩 Rule: _If p → q, and q → r, then p → r._
📚 Example:
If I study hard (p), I’ll get into a good university (q).
If I get into a good university (q), I’ll get a good job (r).
→ So, if I study hard (p), I’ll get a good job (r)! 💼✨

---

### 4️⃣ **Disjunctive Syllogism**

🧩 Rule: _p ∨ q, and ¬p → q._
🎬 Example:
Either I exercise (p) or watch a movie (q).
I didn’t exercise (¬p).
→ Therefore, I watched a movie (q). 🎞️

---

### 💎 (b) **Auxiliary Rules — Handy Companions in Proofs**

---

### 5️⃣ **Simplification**

🧩 Rule: _From (p ∧ q), infer p._
🏠 Example:
I cleaned my room (p) and washed the dishes (q).
→ Therefore, I cleaned my room (p). ✔️

---

### 6️⃣ **Conjunction**

🧩 Rule: _From p and q, infer (p ∧ q)._
🌞 Example:
I went running (p). I also read a book (q).
→ “I went running and read a book” (p ∧ q). 🏃‍♂️📖

---

### 7️⃣ **Addition**

🧩 Rule: _From p, infer (p ∨ q)._
🎮 Example:
I finished my homework (p).
→ “I finished my homework or played games” (p ∨ q). ✔️

---

### 8️⃣ **Resolution**

🧩 Rule: _From (p ∨ q) and (¬p ∨ r), infer (q ∨ r)._
☕ Example:
I’ll drink coffee (p) or tea (q).
If I don’t drink coffee (¬p), then I’ll drink juice (r).
→ So, I’ll drink tea (q) or juice (r). 🫖🍹

---

### 9️⃣ **Universal Instantiation (UI)**

🧩 Rule: _From ∀x P(x), infer P(c)._
🎓 Example:
All students (x) must submit homework (P(x)).
Xiaoming is a student (c).
→ Therefore, Xiaoming must submit homework (P(c)). 📚

---

### 🔟 **Existential Instantiation (EI)**

🧩 Rule: _From ∃x P(x), infer P(c) for some specific c._
🌸 Example:
There exists someone who loves chocolate (∃x P(x)).
→ That person (let’s call her Euphyllia 💕) loves chocolate (P(Euphie)). 🍫

---

## 💬 **3. Practice Problems (15 mins)**

✨ _Warm-up your logic circuits, Master!_ ⚡

**Example 1**

1. If Xiaoming studies hard, then he’ll get into graduate school.
2. Xiaoming studies hard.
   → Therefore, Xiaoming will get into graduate school.
   🪄 _Rule Used:_ Modus Ponens.

---

**Example 2**

1. If today is a holiday, I’ll exercise.
2. If I exercise, I’ll be happy.
   → Therefore, if today is a holiday, I’ll be happy.
   🌸 _Rule Used:_ Hypothetical Syllogism.

---

**Example 3**

1. It will rain or be sunny.
2. It will not rain.
   → Therefore, it will be sunny. ☀️
   💡 _Rule Used:_ Disjunctive Syllogism.

---

## ⚠️ **4. Common Fallacies — Beware! (10 mins)**

### 🚫 **Affirming the Consequent (Wrong)**

“If I get sick, I’ll have a headache.
I have a headache → Therefore, I’m sick.”
(_Could be stress or lack of sleep!_) 😣

---

### 🚫 **Denying the Antecedent (Wrong)**

“If I get a perfect score, I’ll get a scholarship.
I didn’t get a perfect score → Therefore, no scholarship.”
(_Not true — maybe top 3 students all get it!_) 🎓

---

## 🪄 **5. Group Exercise / Self-Study (5 mins)**

Given:

1. If a number is divisible by 6, then it’s divisible by 3.
2. 12 is divisible by 6.
3. If a number is divisible by 3, its square is also divisible by 3.

🧩 _Question:_ What can you deduce?
💫 _Hint:_ Use **Modus Ponens** twice — chain them together beautifully~
